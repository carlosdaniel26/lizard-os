  Lizard-OS is a toy operating system. Not a product. Not a clone. Just raw low-level computing the way it should be: built from scratch, for learning and control.

## ⚙️ About

Lizard-OS is a hobby kernel and libc written by someone who got tired of black boxes. Inspired by books like *Linux: Just for Fun*, *Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective*, and *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*, this project is where abstraction goes to die — in the best way possible.

It’s not production-ready. It’s not POSIX-compliant. It exists to teach and tinker with the internals of CPUs, memory, filesystems, and hardware protocols.

If you're here to understand how systems work — not how to use systems that already work — welcome.
