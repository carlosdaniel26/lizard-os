  Lizard-OS is an operating system designed for low-level enthusiasts, offering an educational and pragmatic approach for those who want to explore the fundamentals of computing. My interest in this field of Computer Sciense started after reading <i>Linux Just for Fun</i>, which led me to dive deeper into books like <i>Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CSAPP)</i> and <i>Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</i>. This project aims to provide an environment for learning, experimentation, and system optimization.
