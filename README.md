<h1 align="center">Lizard-OS</h1>

<p align="center">
  Lizard-OS is a toy operating system. Not a product. Not a clone. Just raw low-level computing the way it should be: built from scratch, for learning and control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è About

Lizard-OS is a hobby kernel and libc written by someone who got tired of black boxes. Inspired by books like *Linux: Just for Fun*, *Computer Systems: A Programmer‚Äôs Perspective*, and *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*, this project is where abstraction goes to die ‚Äî in the best way possible.

It‚Äôs not production-ready. It‚Äôs not POSIX-compliant. It exists to teach and tinker with the internals of CPUs, memory, filesystems, and hardware protocols.

If you're here to understand how systems work ‚Äî not how to use systems that already work ‚Äî welcome.

## üêç Features (So Far)

- **Multiboot2-compliant bootloader support**  
  `process_multiboot2_tags()` gets all the low-level boot info right after GRUB hands over control.

- **Basic libc-like utilities**  
  Forget glibc. You‚Äôve got:
  - `kprint()`, `kprintf()`, `putchar()` for raw output
  - Custom string functions like `strlen`, `strcmp`, `strsIsEqual`
  - `unsigned_to_string()` and `unsigned_to_hexstring()` for dirty debugging

- **Memory Management**  
  - Physical memory manager (`pmm_init()`, `pmm_reserve_block()`)
  - Paging and early heap (`kmalloc(bytes)`, `kfree()`, `enable_paging()`)

- **Multitasking**  
  - PID allocator, task switching, context saving
  - Cooperative scheduler
  - Functions like `block_task()`, `terminate_task()`, `switch_task()`

- **I/O and Devices**
  - **ATA PIO driver**: `atapio_read_sector()`, `atapio_write_sector()`
  - **RAM Disk** for testing without real disks
  - **Keyboard, PIT, RTC, PIC**, and **basic IDT/GDT setup**
  - Low-level I/O: `inb()`, `outb()`, `io_wait()`, etc.

- **File and VFS layer (WIP)**  
  Basic file abstraction: `vfs_read()`, `vfs_write()`, `vfs_delete()`  
  FAT16 test read to verify BPB and raw file access.

- **Terminal and Shell**  
  - Text-mode framebuffer driver: `draw_char()`, `scroll_framebuffer()`
  - TTY handler with input handling
  - Dumb shell: `shit_shell_init()`, `runcmd()`  
    Yes, that‚Äôs its actual name. It works, get over it.

- **Debugging**
  - Use `dd()` or `debug_printf()` to spit out what you need when you need it.
  - `kprint_task_state()` to inspect tasks.
